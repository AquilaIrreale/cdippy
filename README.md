A classic Diplomacy adjudicator, in C

What's this?
------------

This is an attempt at writing an adjudicator for the classic variant of the
game of Diplomacy in C, motivated by the lack of a publicly available
implementation thereof.

The code is based on the algorithms and equations proposed by Lucas
Kruijswijk in "The Math of Adjudication", available [here][1] for reading.

Development will focus on obtaining a working version as soon as possible,
and then refactoring or rewriting the ugly bits once a stable form is
reached.

Now [DATC][2] [6.A][3] compliant
